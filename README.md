## How It Works

2. Expert Initialization: Initializes the expert advisor and sets the allowed trading hours and trailing stop.
3. Expert Deinitialization: Performs any necessary cleanup or final operations.

5. Fake Out Pattern: A function that checks if a fake out pattern is present based on the current and previous prices. Add your logic to identify the fake out pattern and return true if it is present, false otherwise.
6. Buy Signal: A function that determines the buy signal based on indicators or conditions. Add your logic to determine the buy signal and return true if it is present, false otherwise.
7. Sell Signal: A function that determines the sell signal based on indicators or conditions. Add your logic to determine the sell signal and return true if it is present, false otherwise.
8. Set Trade Hours: A function that allows customization of the allowed trading hours. Add your logic to set the allowed trading hours and return true if successful, false otherwise.
9. Set Trailing Stop: A function that allows customization of the trailing stop. Add your logic to set the trailing stop and return true if successful, false otherwise.
